It turns out that these concepts involve various ñ and sometimes conflicting ñ interpretations and definitions.

The degree of complexation of Eu in 10 mg/l Aldrich HA solutions was determined within a broad range of metal loading (Eu total concentration 10–8–10–4 mol.l–1), at pH 4 and 6, ionic strength of 0.01 and 0.1 (NaClO4). From the anodic electrophoretic mobilities determined, additional information on the charge of the EuHA complexes was obtained. Uncertainty of the determination given by sorption losses of Eu on the walls and membranes of the experimental devices, and the effect of kinetic lability of the Eu-HA complexes are estimated. Based on the ultrafiltration experiments, the existence of an unknown, labile, high-molecular non-humic Eu species is discussed. </p></xsl:when>

Data are processed automatically upon receipt, and then interactively reviewed and screened for detection of CTBT-relevant radionuclides. Atmospheric back-tracking for source location is included in the IDC functions.

While MU had a viable radiochemistry program through existing faculty expertise and the utilization of the Missouri University Research Reactor, the REAP award allowed MU to leverage its resources in significantly expanding capabilities in radiochemistry. Specifically, the grant enabled the: (1) hiring of a new faculty member in actinide radiochemistry (Dr. Paul Duval); (2) support of six graduate students in radiochemistry; (3) purchase of new radiochemistry laboratory equipment; (4) more extensive collaboration with DOE scientists through interactions with faculty and graduate students, and (5) revised radiochemical curriculum (joint courses across disciplines and new courses in actinide chemistry). The most significant impact of this award has been in encouraging interdisciplinary education and research. The proposal was initiated by a joint effort between Nuclear Engineering and Chemistry, but also included faculty in biochemistry, radiology, and molecular biology. Specific outcomes of the REAP grant thus far are: (1) increased educational and research capabilities in actinide chemistry (faculty hire and equipment acquisition); (2) increased integration of biochemistry and radiochemistry (e.g., radiochemical analysis of uranium speciation in biological systems); (3) stronger interdisciplinary integration of molecular biology and radiochemical sciences (alpha-emitters for treating cancer); (4) new and more extensive interactions with national laboratory facilities (e.g., student internships at LANL and LLBL, faculty and lab scientist exchange visits, analytical measurements and collaboration with the Advanced Photon Source), and (7) new research funding opportunities based on REAP partnership.</p></xsl:when>

This ratio varies from 1.5 to 1.9 due to natural causes. The results point to the lack of the technogenic uranium along the Naryn River through territory of the Kyrgyz Republic and to the contamination of the Mailuu-Suu River by technogenic uranium from tailing dumps in the area. The share of technogenic uranium transported to Uzbekistan does not exceed 30%, and the total uranium content is considerably lower than the maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of potable waters of the Chui Valley of Kyrgyz Republic.</p></xsl:when>

Applying conventional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis algorithms to such 3-D spectra is problematic due to spectral interferences in the low-resolution spectra. Deconvolving the 3-D sample spectra into the most probable combination of signals using non-negative least-squares results shows promise to robustly resolve the spectral interferences. This paper describes the multiple isotope component analysis (MICA) algorithm developed for analysis of 3-D - spectra from xenon sampling and measurement units.</p></xsl:when>

Cu levels in transcutaneous obtained full liver biopsies were quantified using INAA and 66Cu. A copper excretion study was performed in a group of completely normal Dobermann dogs and in six Dobermanns with elevated copper levels and suffering from subclinical hepatitis. 64Cu2+ was used to assess whether a normal bile flow and thus excretion was possible. All subjects underwent separately from this 64Cu2+ excretion study a 99mTc-Bis-IDA scintigraphy. The Cu levels in liver of these hepatitis patients vary from 600 to 1600 mg.kg–1 whereas 100–300 mg.kg–1 is probably normal for healthy Dobermann dogs. These Cu levels match fully with histopathology results and clinical observations. Measurements during a 2 years’ evaluation period showed a clear relation between the existence of subclinical hepatitis and increased Cu levels without a sign for cholestasis or an abnormal bile flow.</p></xsl:when>

This new radiotracer method has been applied to the study of 10 food samples and their corresponding recycled paper and board packaging. Samples of paper and board were irradiated in a thermal neutron flux of 1.26.1016 n.m–2.s–1 for 15 hours to activate elements of interest. After a decay period of 10 days the paper and board was placed in contact with the corresponding foodstuff. The food was analyzed for any radioactivity migrating from the packaging by gamma-ray spectrometry. Samples were analyzed regularly during the 90 days contact time. Detection limits for the determination of migration was as low as a few µg/kg in the food. Results from the migration study have shown that, of the 60 elements measured, only Zn and Fe were detected in food, at concentrations of 0.012–0.25, and 0.045–0.11 mg/kg, respectively. This was despite the recycled paper and board samples being highly elevated in many other elements such as Cr (0.9–15.1 mg/kg) and Ba (3.3–75.4 mg/kg). The level of migration of Zn and Fe into food from packaging was insignificant compared to the UK recommended daily allowances of 15 mg, and, therefore, represented no hazard to human health.</p></xsl:when>

The TRU-ES resin is comprised of an inert macroporous polystyrene core impregnated with the organic fluors [diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 1,4-bis-(4-methyl-5-phenyl-2oxazolyl)benzene (DM-POPOP)) and the selective extract (octyl(phenyl)-N, N-diisobutyl-carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO) in tri-butyl phosphate (TBP)]. The TRU-ES resin, packed into translucent FEP Teflon tubing, was placed into a flow-cell scintillation detection system. Acidified aqueous solutions, 233U spiked synthetic ground water and EPA natural uranium QA samples, were pumped through the flow-cell while gross count rate and pulse-height spectra were collected. The increase in count rate is attributed to the uranium being extracted from the aqueous medium and retained by the TRU-ES resin with simultaneous detection of the resultant scintillation photons. The TRU-ES loading efficiency was nearly quantitative out of 2M HNO3 with a flow rate of 0.5 ml.min–1. The detection efficiency was measured to be 51% for 233U. The detection limit was determined to be ~2 Bq.l–1 for 233U based on a resin free column volume of 0.2 ml, and 50 ml of 2M HNO3 acidified groundwater.</p></xsl:when>

In fact, traces of carrier are easily introduced in the radioactive preparations by their presence in the target material, by equipment and chemicals used in target processing, and may also be produced by side nuclear reactions induced in the target by nuclear activation, sometimes followed by a decay chain. Very sensitive analytical and radioanalytical techniques allow the determination of the real value of specific activity of no-carrier-added radionuclides and labeled compounds. Thus, in this paper we show with several examples that in most practical cases the term carrier-free (CF) is used improperly and has to be substituted by the more suitable term no-carrier-added (NCA).

There are several areas where this monitoring can be improved (e.g., analysis times and accurate isotopic ratio measurements). In addition, in case of accidents or exposure to people who are not routinely monitored, the optimum window for collecting bioassay samples may be missed. An example of this scenario is the recent concern over the exposure of civilians to depleted uranium from military ammunition in Kosovo and Kuwait. For these cases, hair may be an alternative bioassay. Analytical procedures utilizing an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) have been developed that have simplified sample processing and improved the isotopic ratio measurements. The focus of this study is to survey the background levels for 235U, 236U, 238U, and 232 Th isotopes in hair, urine, and drinking water which could be used to determine action levels for follow-up monitoring.

The experiment, named Navruz (meaning “new beginning”), uses standardized methods to monitor basic water quality parameters, radionuclides, and metals in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers. Overall, the project addresses three main goals: (1) to help increase capabilities in Central Asian nations for sustainable water resources management; (2) to provide a scientific basis for supporting nuclear transparency and non-proliferation in the region; and (3) to help reduce the threat of conflict in Central Asia over water resources. Contamination of these rivers is a result of growing population, urbanization, agricultural uses, and radioactive and metals contamination from a legacy of uranium mining, industry, and other activities of the former Soviet Union. The project focuses on waterborne radionuclides and metals because of the importance of these contaminants to public health and political stability in Central Asia. Moreover, the method of enabling scientists from bordering countries to study a transboundary problem, can lead to a greater scientific understanding, consensus on necessary mitigation steps, and ultimately the political resolution of the issue.

During an emergency response, the initial analytical data is provided by portable field instrumentation. As incident responders scale up their response based on the seriousness of the incident, local analytical assets and mobile laboratories add additional capability and capacity. During the intermediate phase of the response, data quality objectives and measurement quality objectives are more rigorous. These higher objectives will require the use of larger laboratories, with greater capacity and enhanced capabilities.

The main destructive agents are not coming from external weather conditions, but from humidity originated in the soil with a great variety of dissolved salts. In the laboratory small prism shaped samples of the same raw materials utilized in ancient times have been tested and put in contact with a 1% Na2SO4 solution labeled with 22Na during fixed time periods. In this way, counts obtained divided by weight of each sample gives a figure approximately proportional to its porosity or capacity to absorb humidity from soil, making possible to compare the difference of this condition for several materials, and to test the efficiency of the proposed methods to control this problem. One suitable way to achieve it, seems to be the use of one solution of BaAc, plus thiourea and methyl-methacrylate, in order to form a solid polymer. This method works reasonably well at laboratory level, and even when it has not been tested in the real scale, seems to be cheap and easy enough to slow down the increasing deterioration due to humidity and salts deposits coming from soil. However, even when this polymer is completely insoluble in water, the start of the reaction to form it requires the final addition of hydrogen peroxide, and temperature increase till the boiling point of the reagents, which may be too aggressive for ancient dyes and raw materials.

The Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Group participates in programs that involve analysis of “fresh” fission products by beta counting following radiochemical separations. This is a laborious and time-consuming process that can take several days to generate results. Gamma-spectroscopy can provide a more immediate path to isotopic activities, however, short-lived, high-yield isotopes can swamp a gamma-spectrum, making difficult the identification and quantification of isotopes on the wings and valley of the fission yield curve. The gamma-spectrum of a sample of newly produced fission products is dominated by the many emissions of a very few high-yield isotopes. Specifically, 132Te (T1/2 = 3.2 d), its daughter, 132I (T1/2 = 2.28 h), 140Ba (T1/2 = 12.75 d), and its daughter 140La (T1/2 = 1.68 d) emit at least 18 gamma-rays above 100 keV that are greater than 5% abundance. Additionally, the 1596 keV emission from 140La imposes a Compton background that hinders the detection of isotopes that are neither subject to matrix dependent fractionation nor gaseous or volatile precursors.

The original purpose of airborne radiation mapping in Finland was to identify hazardous areas containing radioactive fall-out after a nuclear accident or use of nuclear weapons. Regular exercises are held annually to keep the operational functionality at a high level. The achieved capability has been well demonstrated in international INEX-2-FIN 1997 and Barents Rescue 2001 exercises. The knowledge and competence achieved can easily be applied in international radiation monitoring campaigns designed to expose undeclared nuclear materials or other clandestine nuclear activities. The essential improvements in the detection system are linked to the ability to locate point-like radiation sources rather than large areas of fall-out. This paper describes the aerial gamma-ray measurement method and its usability for the detection of nuclear material production chains and trails of fission or activation products. The ability of airborne detection systems in revealing the use of undeclared nuclear materials has been tested. Various scenarios for exposing clandestine nuclear material production, enrichment and nuclear waste trails have been considered. Based on detection capability calculations and testing in practice, it was found that the detection of one un-shielded significant quantity of natural uranium (10 tons of yellow cake in storage barrels) is possible through the daughter products, using one single 6"×4" NaI detector on the airplane. The developed fixed wing gamma measurement technique is now able to detect significant amounts of nuclear material conveniently and cost-effectively.

This work entails coupling an Aerosol-to-Liquid Particle Extraction System (ALPES) to an electrochemically modulated separation (EMS) cell. The ALPES collects and concentrates airborne particles into a liquid,1 and the EMS cell separates species based on their affinity for a charged target surface.2 Preliminary data indicates substantial sensitivity enhancement may be realized by interfacing these devices. The system will allow for rapid field analysis of radionuclides while providing reductions in labor, cost, and turnaround time compared to standard radiometric techniques.</p></xsl:when>
